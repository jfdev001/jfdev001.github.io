I am a Scientific Programmer in the Modelling of Atmospheric Processes 
department of the [Leibniz Institute for Atmospheric Physics](https://www.iap-kborn.de/en/research/modelling-of-atmospheric-processes/). 
I previously completed my MSc in Computational Science at the University of 
Amsterdam (UvA) funded by the 
[Amsterdam Merit Scholarship](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/fees-and-funding/masters-scholarships-and-loans/faculty-scholarships-science/science.html) 
and specialized in high performance computing and distributed
discretization methods (see [GalerkinToolkit.jl](https://github.com/GalerkinToolkit/GalerkinToolkit.jl)) for the fast numerical 
solution of PDEs. Before UvA, I completed my B.S. in Computer Science at Middle 
Tennessee State University and was the recipient of the 
[Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/2020-goldwater-scholars-by-institution-state/).

While a portion of my bachelor's studies was dedicated to analytical chemistry
research on forensically relevant materials as well as nanomaterials, my work 
now is centered around DevOps, automation, visualization, and code 
sustainability for the upper atmosphere codes of the 
[Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) Model](https://www.dwd.de/EN/research/weatherforecasting/num_modelling/01_num_weather_prediction_modells/icon_description.html), one
of the world's leading global climate and numerical weather prediction models.

Outside of work I enjoy language learning (Dutch, German, and Italian), 
playing guitar, calisthenics, and hiking. I also enjoy contributing to 
open-source projects! I am currently working on documentation/tutorial
for [Ferrite.jl](https://github.com/Ferrite-FEM/Ferrite.jl) 
(a finite element toolbox) and [SpeedyWeather.jl](https://github.com/SpeedyWeather/SpeedyWeather.jl) (an atmospheric modelling framework).
