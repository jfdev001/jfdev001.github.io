I am a Scientific Programmer in the Modelling of Atmospheric Processes 
department of the [Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics](https://www.iap-kborn.de/en/research/modelling-of-atmospheric-processes/) (IAP). 
I previously completed a M.Sc. in Computational Science at the University of 
Amsterdam (UvA) funded by the 
[Amsterdam Merit Scholarship](https://www.uva.nl/en/education/fees-and-funding/masters-scholarships-and-loans/faculty-scholarships-science/science.html) 
and specialized in high performance computing with a particular interest in 
distributed discretization methods (see [GalerkinToolkit.jl](https://github.com/GalerkinToolkit/GalerkinToolkit.jl)) 
and numerical methods for partial differential equations. Before the UvA, I completed 
a B.S. in Computer Science at Middle Tennessee State University and was the 
recipient of the [Goldwater Scholarship](https://goldwaterscholarship.gov/2020-goldwater-scholars-by-institution-state/).

My work now is centered around DevOps, automation, visualization, and code 
sustainability for the upper atmosphere codes of the 
[Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) Model](https://www.dwd.de/EN/research/weatherforecasting/num_modelling/01_num_weather_prediction_modells/icon_description.html), one
of the world's leading global climate and numerical weather prediction models.
I also develop in-house software to support the scientists at the IAP
and collaborate with the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ) and the 
German Weather Service (DWD) on refactoring the ICON upper atmosphere codes. 

Outside of work, I enjoy language learning (Dutch, German, and Italian),
playing guitar, calisthenics, cooking, and hiking. I also enjoy contributing to
open-source projects (see [my
contributions](https://jfdev001.github.io/cv#foss))
and [blogging](https://jfdev001.github.io//year-archive/) about topics in
computational science as well as miscellaneous software topics!
