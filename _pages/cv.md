## Career Interests
I am a budding specialist in HPC with performance optimization, automation, and
DevOps competencies honed during my time as a Scientific Programmer at the Leibniz
Institute of Atmospheric Physics. I am eager to contribute this plus diverse
skills in scientific modeling and simulation, finite element methods,
fundamentals of fluid and atmospheric dynamics, and more to a software
engineering role.
