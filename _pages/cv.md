## Career Interests
I am an early career specialist in HPC with performance optimization,
automation, and DevOps competencies honed during my time as a Scientific
Programmer at the Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics. I am eager to
contribute these plus diverse skills in scientific modelling and simulation to a
software engineering role.

## Experience

**Research Software Engineer – Leibniz Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP)**  
*October 2024 – Present*  
- Improved performance and efficiency of internal terabyte-scale climate data processing pipelines (e.g., cut runtimes from 4 hours to 30 minutes with 8x speedup).
- Implemented significant build system and CI improvements in leading open source scientific machine learning library (FTorch) to support integration of PyTorch-based machine learning models into ICON weather and climate model ([PRs](https://github.com/Cambridge-ICCS/FTorch/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Aclosed+review%3Aapproved+author%3A%40me)).
- Standardized internal development workflows by introducing GitLab-based version control as well as CI by deploying a lightweight GitLab runner on a Raspberry Pi to support internal static analysis and automation workflows ([blog](https://jfdev001.github.io/posts/2026/02/gitlab-runner-on-raspberry-pi/)).
- Developed and maintained in-house visualization tools for scientific analysis and publications, generating figures from processing terabytes of climate data using software I built with GNU Parallel ([journal article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10712-025-09915-6#Ack1)).
- Provided engineering support for the ICON weather and climate model, including debugging, extensive documentation, and user support for a complex, production-grade HPC codebase.
- Supervised high school interns in climate data analysis and visualization.

**M.Sc. Thesis: Discretization of Mechanical Metamaterials on Large-Scale Parallel Computers**  
*Nov 2023 – Aug 2024*

- See: [GalerkinToolkit.jl](https://github.com/)  

**Intern for Imaging Biomarkers and Computer-Aided Diagnosis – National Institutes of Health**  
*Jun 2022 – Aug 2022*  
- Conducted full-time machine learning research funded by NIH.  
- Developed state-of-the-art computer vision models for 3D universal lesion detection in CT scans using the MMDetection framework.
- Wrote and submitted [conference paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023SPIE12465E..38F/abstract) describing improvement over state-of-the-art.

**B.S. Thesis: Machine Learning in Atmospheric Science**  
*Aug 2021 – Mar 2022*  
- Implemented linear regression, random forest, LSTM/GRU RNNs, and CNNs for multi-step ambient temperature prediction on Mars using Curiosity Rover weather data.  

**NSF REU: Machine Learning in Drug Design – University of Michigan**  
*Jun 2021 – Aug 2021*  
- Implemented variational autoencoders for mapping discrete molecular representations to continuous representations.  

<span id="foss"></span>
**Nano/Forensic Chemistry Research Assistant – MTSU**  
*Jan 2019 – Aug 2020*  
- Designed experiments and collected data using direct analysis in real time (DART) ambient ionization with mass spectrometry.
