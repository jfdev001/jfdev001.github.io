The germinal center (GC) exit pathway, whose mechanisms are
critical for understanding the immune response, was modeled as a system of ordinary 
differential equations. The system was first decomposed into two relevant subnetworks,
and steady state analysis of key transcription factors relevant for the terminal 
differentiation of naive GC B cells to short term immune response plasma cells 
(PCs) or long term
immune response memory B cells (MBCs) was performed. Associated bifurcation analyses
and system phase spaces were used to elucidate the conditions under which the differentia-
tion of naive GC B cells (aka centroblasts) to MBCs or PCs occurred. The model and 
subsequent analyses was implemented in Julia
