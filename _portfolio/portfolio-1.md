An algebraic multigrid (AMG) implementation in C++ developed using
Eigen3 for linear algebra operations and Catch2 for unit testing. Includes a 
full CI/CD pipeline via GitHub with static code analysis and multiplatform (Linux,
Windows, MacOS) support. Documentation autogenerated using Doxygen and hosted on 
GitHub pages.
